# Hi, Iâ€™m Glad Youâ€™re Here!  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Iâ€™m passionate about programming and science, solving tricky problems, and sharing what I learn along the way. With over 15 years of experience in tech, Iâ€™ve worn many hatsâ€”from developer to technical leaderâ€”delivering software that not only works but truly makes an impact.

## **A Peek into My Journey**  

My career has been a whirlwind of exciting challenges and  milestones. 

Right now, Iâ€™m a **Software Developer**, where I get to design and scale movement analytics platforms, work with cutting-edge machine learning models, and solve complex problems that span three continents. Some of the coolest things Iâ€™ve built recently include a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for motion classification and a seamless chat integration using AWS Chime.  

Before this, Iâ€™ve been:
- **Turning IoT into something magical** at Azuga Inc, where we built real-time apps connected to OBD-2 devices and dabbled in machine learning.
- **A champion for clean code** at Workforce Software, where agile teams and test-driven development were my playground.

## **Whatâ€™s in My Toolkit?**  

I love working with:
- **Languages** like Java, React, Node.js, and Flutter.  
- **Cloud Technologies** such as GCP, AWS, and Firebase.  
- **Machine Learning** magic like CNNs and pose detection.  
- And making deployments smooth with **CI/CD pipelines** and serverless architecture.  

Every day is an opportunity to learn and add more tools to the kit.

## **When Iâ€™m Not Codingâ€¦**  

Life isnâ€™t all about the keyboard and monitor (though itâ€™s pretty close sometimes). Hereâ€™s how I stay inspired:  
- **Travel**: Wandering the streets of Japan, savoring gelato in Italy, or hiking trails in the Himalayasâ€”I love soaking in new cultures and cuisines.  
- **Photography**: My camera is my constant travel buddy, and landscapes and cityscapes are my favorite subjects.  
- **Fitness**: Whether itâ€™s running marathons or cycling through scenic routes, I love being outdoors and active.

## **My Side Quests**  

- **Open Source**: Sharing knowledge is my way of giving back to the developer community.  
- **Blogging**: Writing about tech trends and real-world ML applications keeps me sharp.  
- **Mentoring**: I believe in growing together, so I love helping junior developers level up their skills.

## **Something Fun**  

A few years back, I participated in a hackathon, and my team built an app that predicts the best time for outdoor activities using machine learning and weather data. We won first place, but more importantly, we had a blast doing it!
